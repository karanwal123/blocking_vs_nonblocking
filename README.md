**Project Title: File Reading Operations in Node.js: Synchronous vs Asynchronous**

**Project Description:**

This project demonstrates the two primary ways of reading files in Node.js: **synchronously (Blocking)** using `fs.readFileSync()` and **asynchronously (Non-Blocking)** using `fs.readFile()`. It explores the differences in behavior, performance, and use cases of both methods in file handling.

In this project, you will:
1. **Implement File Reading with `fs.readFileSync()`**: This method reads files synchronously, meaning the program halts at the file reading operation until it is completed. It is simple but can cause performance issues in larger applications due to its blocking nature.

2. **Implement File Reading with `fs.readFile()`**: This method reads files asynchronously, meaning the program continues executing while the file is being read in the background. It allows for more efficient handling of file operations, especially when dealing with large files or performing multiple I/O operations concurrently.

By comparing the two techniques, the project aims to help users understand the trade-offs involved in choosing between synchronous and asynchronous file reading in Node.js. It also provides practical examples, including scenarios where each method would be more suitable depending on the application's needs. 

**Key Concepts Covered:**
- Synchronous vs Asynchronous operations in Node.js
- Using the `fs` module for file I/O
- Performance implications of blocking vs non-blocking operations
- Error handling in both synchronous and asynchronous methods

**Target Audience:**
This project is aimed at Node.js beginners and developers looking to understand the basics of file handling and how to choose between synchronous and asynchronous operations based on application requirements.
